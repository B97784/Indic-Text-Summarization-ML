# Indic Language Text Summarization using Deep Learning Based Approach

## Introduction
Text summarization is an essential task in Natural Language Processing (NLP), aimed at generating concise versions of lengthy texts while preserving key information. This project explores deep learning-based approaches for summarizing texts in Indic languages, such as Bangla, Hindi, Kannada, and Tamil. These languages present unique challenges, including complex scripts, rich morphology, and a scarcity of annotated datasets. By leveraging advanced techniques like LSTM-based encoder-decoder architectures, the project aims to push the boundaries of NLP for low-resource languages and improve accessibility for diverse linguistic communities.


## Overview
This project aims at developing and deploying a text summarization system for Indic languages, focusing on both extractive and abstractive summarization techniques. The key features include:
- Support for Bangla, Hindi, Kannada, Tamil, and other Indic languages.
- Use of deep learning models, specifically LSTM-based encoder-decoder architectures, to handle the linguistic diversity and complexity of Indic scripts.
- Streamlit-based web application for user interaction, enabling real-time text summarization.
The project's applications span across various domains, such as news aggregation, educational content simplification, and government document accessibility.


## Setup Instructions
### Prerequisites
- Python 3.7 or higher
- Google Colab (for training the model)
- Streamlit for deployment
### Steps
1. Clone this repository:
   git clone https://github.com/username/IndicTextSummarization.git
   cd IndicTextSummarization
2. Install required Python packages:
pip install -r requirements.txt
3. Train the model:
Open the provided Google Colab notebook (train_model.ipynb) and follow the steps to train the LSTM-based summarization model.
4. Run the Streamlit application:
streamlit run app.py
5. Access the web app at http://localhost:8501 and start summarizing text in Indic languages.
